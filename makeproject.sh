# On my honor:
#
# - I have not discussed my bash script with
# anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
# assigned to this course.
#
# - I have not used bash scripts obtained from another student,
# the Internet, or any other unauthorized source, either modified
# or unmodified.
#
# - If any bash script or documentation used in my program
# was obtained from an authorized source, such as a text book or
# course notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation
# in the comments of my script.
#
# - I have not designed this script in such a way as to defeat or
# interfere with normal grading.
